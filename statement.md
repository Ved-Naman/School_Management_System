# Project Statement – Student Management System

## Problem Statement
In many schools, basic student and teacher information is still handled using registers or simple spreadsheets.  
This becomes messy when records need to be updated or searched regularly.  
To avoid this inconvenience, I decided to build a small Student Management System that stores the data properly and allows quick updates whenever required.

## Scope of the Project
The project mainly focuses on two sections:
- Students
- Teachers

For both, the system supports simple operations like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting entries.  
It is built as a command-line program and uses SQLite so that the data stays saved even after closing the program.  
The aim was to keep the code modular and easy to understand rather than over-complicating it.

## Target Users
This system can be used by:
- School office staff who maintain records
- Teachers who need quick access to student info
- Anyone learning the basics of Python + databases

It is mainly meant for small-scale use or learning purposes.

## High-Level Features
- Store student and teacher details in a database
- Menu-based CLI for easy navigation
- CRUD operations for both modules  
- Basic error handling (e.g., duplicate IDs)
- Simple object-oriented structure for data modelling
